The project envisions illuminating the Bilbao river using strategically placed lights that activate only when users are present and ambient light levels are low, as detected by sensors. By seamlessly integrating technology, the initiative aims to enhance both safety and energy efficiency along the riverbanks. This innovative approach not only fosters a sustainable urban environment but also provides a unique and responsive lighting system that adapts to the specific needs of the community, creating a captivating experience for residents and visitors alike.
